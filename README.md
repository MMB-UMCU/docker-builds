This repository contains container recipes (Dockerfiles) for software and tools created by the BioIT group of the Medical Microbiology department of UMC Utrecht. At the moment, we focus on Docker images that are translatable to Singularity.

All our Docker images are automatically built to DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/u/mmbumcu
